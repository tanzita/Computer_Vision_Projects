# Computer_Vision_Projects

Here, I am uploading different projects on computer vision.

## Detecting Face using OpenCV
In Face_Detection_OpenCV folder I uploaded a script which will detect frontal face and eyes. I used OpenCV for face and eye detection

It uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to classify frontal face and haarcascade_eye.xml to classify eyes. I have uploaded the harr cascade files and a sample frontal picture also.
